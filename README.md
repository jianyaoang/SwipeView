# SwipeView
Create zoom-in and out effect on an image with the combination of UIScrollView and SwipeView framework <br>
<p>
This effect can be seen in apps like Facebook. Before implementing this, I encountered issue where using the built-in zoom-in and out effect via UIScrollView moves
the entire scrollview instead of the specific image itself. Using SwipeView library, I was able to combine both functionality of SwipeView and UIScrollView</p>
